Parallel computing is an approach that harnesses many computing resources together to solve problems, and it has become pervasive across domains such as simulation, graphics, and artificial intelligence, where it is relied on to improve both speed and accuracy. Among the many parallel architectures in use today, multicore CPUs and GPUs are the most common platforms students will encounter in practice. The goal of the course is to build intuition for when and why parallelization pays off, and to equip students with foundational programming techniques for designing and implementing parallel programs on these mainstream architectures.",

In parallel, teams carry out a project-based experience that mirrors how engineering work is actually done—scoping problems, iterating concepts, communicating ideas, and integrating feedback—so that participants leave with both structured methods for design thinking and firsthand practice of collaborative engineering design.",

          description: "This course is designed to help students build a solid foundation in modern C++ programming while developing a deep, practical understanding of object-oriented programming principles and the habits of thought needed to apply them in real software. Through lectures, exercises, and design-oriented assignments, participants learn to write clear, maintainable, and efficient code, to model problems with appropriate abstractions, and to reason about encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition in the context of small and medium-sized systems. Emphasis is placed on moving beyond syntax to genuine design judgment—evaluating trade-offs, structuring responsibilities among classes, and refactoring toward better structure—so that graduates leave with both technical proficiency in C++ and the conceptual tools to grow as thoughtful object-oriented designers.",

In the descriptive part, students learn how to summarize and visualize collected data in ways that reveal structure without overclaiming. The probability segment develops core ideas of chance, random variables, and distributions as the language for quantifying uncertainty. The inferential part then turns to methods for drawing justified conclusions about populations from samples, connecting each step to the earlier material.",
